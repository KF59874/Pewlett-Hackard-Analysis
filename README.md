# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

For this part of the Challenge, youâ€™ll write a report to help the manager prepare for the upcoming "silver tsunami."

The analysis should contain the following:

# Overview 
This analysis has been conducted to provide insight on staff who are retiring from Pwelett-Hackard. This analysis aided in creating a mentorship program to reduce the potential detrementous impact of having a large amount of employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955, retire at the same time. A mentorship program for eligble employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965, could help reduce the loss of employees.  

# Results
The following results have been uncovered:
- Out of all 300024 employees, 72,458 staff are retiring. This means 24.15% of the entire staff population will be retiring. 
- Staff  will be retiring from the following 7 job titles: Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer, Staff, Technique Leader, Assistant Engineer, and Manager
- The highest number of staff are leaving their positions as Senior Engineer and Senior Staff
- From the total amount of retiring staff (72,458), only 1549 are eligible for the mentorship program
